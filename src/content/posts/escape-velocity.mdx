Escape Velocity is a soundtrack created by Anti-General for the Three-Body animation.
The theme is about the escape velocity of the universe, which is the speed at which
an object can break free from gravity and move freely in space. The escape velocity
is determined by gravity and the mass of the object. The heavier the object, the
greater the required escape velocity.

In physics, escape velocity is an important concept that applies not only to the universe but also to other fields. For example, the speed of a rocket launch must be higher than the escape velocity of the Earth in order to enter space. Escape velocity can also be used to explain the interactions between celestial bodies, such as planet formation and the trajectory of comets. Therefore, escape velocity is a very interesting and important physical quantity.
