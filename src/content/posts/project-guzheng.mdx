Project Guzheng is a piece of music composed by Anti-General and "Yi Si Si Ye" as a soundtrack for the Three-Body animation. Project Guzheng is a famous event in the first part of "The Three-Body Problem," which showcases the genius of Shi Qiang's creativity.

Guzheng is a traditional Chinese musical instrument. In this soundtrack, Anti-General invited guzheng musician "Yi Si Si Ye" to add guzheng elements to the music. These elements make the soundtrack more diverse and bring a deeper emotional experience for the audience. At the same time, it is also a tribute to traditional Chinese culture, allowing more people to understand and appreciate this beautiful instrument and music culture.
