The following content is translated from "big tail dragon", [https://www.zhihu.com/question/334709042/answer/2313497819](https://www.zhihu.com/question/334709042/answer/2313497819)

> Several other police officers present tried to quiet Shi Qiang, who was bold enough to speak to a high-ranking official like Chang Weisi in such a manner. Wang Miao was surprised, but Chang's retort was even sharper.  
> "Shi Qiang, it seems your old habits from your military days haven't changed. Can you represent the police? You've been suspended for months now due to your bad behavior, and you're about to be removed from the public security system. I brought you here because I value your experience in urban policing. You need to cherish this opportunity."

Shi Qiang had already known Chang Weisi and other high-ranking officials for a long time and had a close relationship with them. He had been Zhuang Yan's uncle for a long time. Otherwise, it would have been too presumptuous to call an unfamiliar beauty "Yan Yan," a nickname that only very familiar elders can use. I suspect that Shi Qiang is the son of 10th-ranked Chang Weisi's old comrade-in-arms and lives in a military compound.

> Shi Qiang said loudly, "So I've earned a pardon? Don't you say those experiences of mine are all crooked ways?"

Shi Qiang did not believe Chang Weisi's words. It was obvious that he knew the person who had specifically requested his participation was not Chang Weisi, but someone even more senior, the 10th-ranked official. Before Shi Qiang proposed the Guzheng plan, Chang Weisi did not show him any respect at all, completely unlike someone who had requested his participation. Chang Weisi called Shi Qiang "Da Shi," not "Xiao Shi" or "Xiao Qiang," which suggests a relationship between peers. Earlier in the text, Shi Qiang had talked with Wang Miao about one of his comrades-in-arms being Chang Weisi.

> "I have several old comrades-in-arms who are now generals, so I know some things."  
> "With such a big event, why hasn't the news media reacted at all?"  
> "This is another incredible phenomenon: all countries keep it secret at the same time, and they keep it so tightly. I can be sure of one thing now: the enemy is a tough character, and those above are afraid! I know Chang Weisi too well. From him, I can tell that he's a person who isn't afraid even if the sky falls. But now, it's not just the sky that may be falling. They're scared to death, and they simply don't have the confidence to beat that enemy."

Shi Qiang obviously did not respect Chang Weisi. He felt that Chang Weisi did not regard him as an important person.

> "There are so many important people here. I was afraid it wouldn't be my turn just now. If that happened, you, the old leader, would say I was impolite again."  
> "You're already beyond impolite! Quickly, tell us your tricks!"

Shi Qiang's squad was a second-generation military squad. As a criminal investigator and veteran, although his ultimate goal was good, using torture to extract confessions, organizing the use of the mafia to fight the mafia, and so on, were still too arrogant and audacious, not something that ordinary people could do. There was an obvious aura of military second-generation dominance around Shi Qiang.
