The following content is translated from "big tail dragon", [https://www.zhihu.com/question/334709042/answer/2313497819](https://www.zhihu.com/question/334709042/answer/2313497819)

The love between Zhuang Yan and Luo Ji was extremely perfect. In reality, Zhuang Yan has some flaws, such as being a bit short, but this flaw was smoothed over by Shi Qiang's skillful deception.

> **Shi Qiang waved his hand to stop him**,"Last point: she is not tall, about 160, slender, the kind that can be blown away by a gust of wind, so she doesn't look short... of course, there are many other things that can be said, and they should all be roughly the same."

See, Shi Qiang didn't allow Luo Ji to express his opinions at all. Zhuang Yan's family background, characteristics, and everything else were all said by Shi Qiang, causing Luo Ji's vague dream to collapse and manifest according to Shi Qiang's will. Shi Qiang, Shi Qiang, you are the strongest matchmaker in history.

In fact, Luo Ji's core requirement was only one: a young beauty. Ideally, a student (Luo's teacher's view of finding beautiful women is so limited that he doesn't know any other types of beautiful women). Why did Shi Qiang say 160 but not short? Shi the swindler specifically used the word "not short" to replace "short" to avoid negative vocabulary. Because in fact, 170 with long legs is more in line with Luo Ji's aesthetics.

Anyway, in the original book, all the solid information about Zhuang Yan's family, characteristics, appearance, etc. were all said by Shi Qiang. Luo Ji didn't say a word, not that he didn't want to, but every time he opened his mouth, he was interrupted by Shi Qiang. If Luo Ji was really allowed to speak for himself, he would definitely say that the height should be at least 165, which would eliminate Zhuang Yan. This Zhuang Yan is only 160, which is almost 155. Shi Qiang spoke fluently about Zhuang Yan's family background, but he stuttered and stumbled when he got to 160, and explained for a long time that she was slim, so she didn't look short. You introduce someone who is less than 160, can you justify the trust of a regular ball-level leader in you?

Shi Qiang's routine starts from the beginning. Your dream, I can realize it, and you will be satisfied. They are all men... Shi Qiang first gained Luo Ji's trust, and then slowly guided Luo Ji to define his dream lover as the one he designed. Only then did he mention the flaw of being less than 160, but by this time, Luo Ji had already identified with Shi Qiang, so he didn't care about this small flaw.

The real requirement for Luo Ji's dream lover is described in the following paragraph:

> **Something inside Luo Ji seemed to be ignited**, and he stood up, pacing restlessly back and forth in front of the fireplace. "She... how do I put this? When she came into this world, it was like a lily growing out of a garbage heap, so... so pure and delicate, everything around her couldn't possibly pollute her, but everything is a harm to her! Yes, everything around her can harm her! Your first reaction to her is to protect her... no, to cherish her, to keep her from being hurt by this crude and barbaric reality, **you are willing to pay any price for this!** She... she is so... well, you see how clumsy and inarticulate I am, I haven't said anything clearly."

However, later events show that Shi Qiang didn't even pay attention to Luo Ji's core requirement. Zhuang Yan, the daughter of martyr Zhuang Yu, is indeed tough on the outside and tender on the inside. She has extraordinary courage to face the end of the world, and is not a delicate little flower at all. The Zhuang Yan brought by Shi Qiang does not meet Luo Ji's requirements. This paragraph also shows that Luo Ji has guardian genes, and Zhuang Yan will ignite Luo Ji's guardian genes with the flame of love and assist him in completing the great cause of guarding humanity.
