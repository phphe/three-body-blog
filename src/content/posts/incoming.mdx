"Incoming" is a soundtrack created by Anti-General for the production of the Three-Body animation. This piece of music gives the listener a feeling of being in the vast universe and sensing an unknown object gradually approaching. The grand atmosphere and sense of urgency make people involuntarily immersed in it, as if exploring the unknown universe. This song gives people a sense of amazing creativity and musical talent, and is a classic that should not be missed.
