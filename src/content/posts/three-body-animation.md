The Three-Body animation is a production by Bilibili released on December 10th, 2022. The animation starts from the second book of the Three-Body novel series, with the first episode depicting the Guzheng operation. The animation deviates from the novel in many ways, adding some plotlines that were not in the book. The animation has sparked a lot of controversy, but I think the first two episodes are pretty good.

The animation has not been released on YouTube. Its address is: [https://www.bilibili.com/bangumi/play/ep704473](https://www.bilibili.com/bangumi/play/ep704473). Due to possible limitations in your network, you may not be able to watch it.
