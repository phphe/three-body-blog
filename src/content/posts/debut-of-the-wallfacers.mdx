Debut of the Wallfacers is a soundtrack created by Anti-General and Yang Bowen for the Three-Body animated series. In the well-known Wallfacer project in the Three-Body novel, there are four so-called Wallfacers. These Wallfacers represent different personalities, cultures, and professional backgrounds. They come from all over the world and live in different social strata. The purpose of this soundtrack is to showcase the uniqueness of each Wallfacer, while also highlighting the importance and influence of the Wallfacer project, which is a very challenging task.

In addition, Yang Bowen also used the shakuhachi instrument to add more elements to this music. This ancient instrument injected a fresh breath into the music, making the entire soundtrack more profound and layered. In order to achieve better musical effects, Anti-General and Yang Bowen have also made a lot of attempts and experiments, constantly iterating and improving. The final result presented to the audience is a very outstanding musical work.
