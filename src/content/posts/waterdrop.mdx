"Waterdrop" is a music piece produced by Anti-General and Lu Nan based on the theme of "Waterdrop vs Human Space Fleet" in their novels. Through the use of various instruments, the music vividly depicts the magnificence and shock of the human space fleet. In the first half, it shows the technology and power of humanity, leaving a deep impression on people. However, in the second half, it reveals the arrogance and ignorance of humanity and the strength of Waterdrop. The music expresses Waterdrop's invincibility and warning to humanity. Overall, "Waterdrop" is a music piece full of tension.
