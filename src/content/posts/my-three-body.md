My Three Body is a Chinese animated series created by Shen You Ba Fang. The series consists of 11 episodes and depicts the storyline of the first book in the Three Body novel series. The animation makes use of the art resources from the famous game "Minecraft". It was released on February 27, 2014. As it was the company's first attempt, the quality of the animation was not very high due to technical immaturity. However, the two subsequent works released by the company were excellent.
